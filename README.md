## Notes to self:
This section contains things that I should keep in mind regarding the development of .NET applications.

- Test your queries before adding them to your data access code.
  - Don't rely on backups to protect you from making bad decisions.
  - If you're going to run an update/delete, check with a select statement first to see which rows that are going to be affected.

- Seperate your user interface from your data access.
